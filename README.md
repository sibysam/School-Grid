# School-Grid
Mini Project : School Grid

Abstract :
School Grid is an innovative web-based platform designed to revolutionize school evaluation 
systems through transparent, data-driven rankings. The system addresses critical gaps in 
existing school assessment frameworks by providing a comprehensive evaluation 
methodology based on multiple performance indicators including academic performance 
(40%), infrastructure (15%), sports (10%), arts (10%), student-teacher ratio (5%), and 
sustainability and community engagement (20%). 
The platform features a three-tier architecture with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend 
development, Firebase for backend services, and CSS for responsive UI design. Key 
functionalities include secure role-based authentication, manual ranking verification by 
administrators, real-time school comparison tools. 
School Grid distinguishes itself from existing solutions through its emphasis on transparency, 
with clear ranking methodologies visible to all stakeholders. The manual verification process 
ensures data credibility, while the responsive interface makes the platform accessible across 
devices. For schools, the system provides valuable insights through detailed performance 
analytics and benchmarking tools. Parents and students benefit from intuitive search 
interfaces and comprehensive school profiles. 
Future enhancements planned include AI-assisted ranking validation, geolocation-based school discovery, and 
mobile application development to broaden accessibility.
